The isomorphs need to be optionally visualized in the UI.


isomorphs should be ordered by how interesting they are.
A checkbox should be added to turn the isomorph visualization on or off.

When the isomorph visualization is on, a vertically-scrollable container should
be added below the full deck state container.
The isomorphs should be displayed in clickable containers ordered by most interesting
from top to bottom and left to right within the container.
When an isomorph is selected, the isomorph internal container should be visually
highlighted and the substrings in the ciphertext which correspond to the isomorph
should also be highlighted.

Substring 1 and 2 should be highlighted in different colors in the ciphertext output.
