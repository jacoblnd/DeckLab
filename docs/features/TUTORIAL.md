The DeckLab tool is currently complex enough that it requires an overview/tutorial
section somewhere.

This should be implemented as a large modal which can be opened with a button.

The button should be titled "Show Tutorial".

The tutorial modal should be vertically scrollable so that all the tutorial contents
can fit inside.


The tutorial should start with an overview which includes what the tool is generally and
some brief background on what a deck cipher is, what these specific deck ciphers are and
how they fit into the noita eye messages (see the README.md at the top-level of the
repo to understand this).

After that brief overview, the tutorial should provide a basic overview of the features
of the DeckLab tool with a description on the left and any useful visuals on the right.

The tutorial modal should be closable by clicking anywhere outside the modal or by
clicking a close "X" button on the top right.
