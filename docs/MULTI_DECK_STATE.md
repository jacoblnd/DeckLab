Add a new side-scrollable component on the right side of the app.


This side-scrollable component will be a visual representation of each deck state
at each Ciphertext symbol from left to right in columns. Each column should show
the deck for one Ciphertext symbol. The deck should be ordered from top to bottom
in the column.
